Meera Enterprises is a multinational Trading company which is selling household, personal care, eatables, office supplies and other essential items over both offline and online modes. Purchase cost for all the items keeps varying periodically by its Vendors.The company will procure from vendors as soon as it starts receiving orders from customers and the TAT for shipment of orders has different priorities depending on the mode of purchase (Offline or Online).Meera Enterprises promises to give away good will amount if they exceed the TAT for shipment of orders based on the purchase order value. I have shared my recommendation and analysis for the data.
